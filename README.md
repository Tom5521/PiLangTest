# Pi languaje test 
This is a set of source codes in different languages to compare the computational speed of PI, using the Leibniz algorithm applied in:

Compiled:
- Go
- Rust
- C++
- C
Interpreted:
- Python
- Lua
- Ruby

There are specific scripts to compile and test everything in the corresponding languages (test.* and build.*).

I strongly recommend using python scripts regardless of your system, unless you do not want to use/install python on your system.
